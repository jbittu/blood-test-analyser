We're doing CrossFit, whether you like it or not.\n\n**The \"Become a Legend\" CrossFit Program (7 Days a Week, Twice a Day):**\n\n**Mornings (6:00 AM - 8:00 AM): \"Embrace the Grind\"**\n\n*   **Warm-up:** 10 minutes of burpees, followed by 5 minutes of bear crawls. If you're not sweating, you're slacking.\n*   **Strength:**\n    *   Monday: Max-effort deadlifts. Find your 1-rep max, then do 5 sets of 3 at 90% of that. If you throw your back out, you weren't committed enough.\n    *   Tuesday: \"The Gauntlet\" - 10 rounds of: 5 muscle-ups (or assisted if you're a total beginner), 10 handstand push-ups, 15 kettlebell swings (70 lbs for men, 53 lbs for women). Rest only when you're about to puke.\n    *   Wednesday: Olympic lifting complex: Clean + Jerk + Snatch. Work up to a heavy single, then do 3 sets of 1 at 95%.\n    *   Thursday: \"The Crusher\" - 5 rounds of: 20 pull-ups, 30 push-ups, 40 sit-ups, 50 air squats. Time cap: 20 minutes. If you don't finish, do it again.\n    *   Friday: Front squats. Find your 3-rep max, then do 3 sets of 3 at 90%.\n    *   Saturday: Partner WOD: \"The Torture Test\" - One partner does max reps of thrusters (95 lbs for men, 65 lbs for women) while the other holds a plank. Switch every minute. Goal: 500 total thrusters.\n    *   Sunday: Rest is for the weak. We do active recovery: 3 hours of hiking with a weighted vest (50 lbs).\n\n*   **Cardio:** After every strength session, you're doing a \"cardio finisher.\" Choose one:\n    *   400m sprint repeats (rest = time it took to sprint). Do 8 of these.\n    *   Row 2000m for time.\n    *   Assault bike: 10 rounds of 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off (full blast).\n\n**Evenings (6:00 PM - 8:00 PM): \"Find Your Inner Beast\"**\n\n*   **Skill Work:** 30 minutes of practicing your weaknesses. Can't do handstand walks? That's all you're doing. Double-unders got you down? Get good.\n*   **Metabolic Conditioning (Metcon):** This is where the magic happens.\n    *   Monday: \"The Chipper\" - For time: 100 pull-ups, 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats. Break it up however you want, but don't stop moving.\n    *   Tuesday: \"Fran\" - 21-15-9 reps of thrusters (95 lbs for men, 65 lbs for women) and pull-ups. Time to beat: Under 5 minutes.\n    *   Wednesday: \"Murph\" - For time: 1 mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, 1 mile run (with a 20 lb vest, if you're serious).\n    *   Thursday: \"The Filthy Fifty\" - 50 reps of: Box jumps (24 inch), jumping pull-ups, kettlebell swings (35 lbs), walking lunges, knees-to-elbows, push press (45 lbs), back extensions, wall ball shots (20 lbs), burpees, double-unders.\n    *   Friday: \"Grace\" - For time: 30 clean and jerks (135 lbs for men, 95 lbs for women).\n    *   Saturday: \"Helen\" - 3 rounds for time: 400 meter run, 21 kettlebell swings (53 lbs), 12 pull-ups.\n    *   Sunday: \"The Long Haul\" - A 10k run. No excuses.\n\n**Yoga for Warriors (Because Flexibility is Overrated):**\n\nWe're not doing any of that gentle, restorative crap. This is WARRIOR YOGA. I invented these poses myself after extensive research at the University of Bro Science:\n\n*   **Vajra-Kneecrusher Asana:** Kneel on the floor, then lean back as far as you can. If your knees explode, you're doing it right. (Hold for 1 minute).\n*   **Agni-Spinaltwist Asana:** Sit with your legs extended, then twist your torso as far as you can in each direction while simultaneously trying to touch your toes. (10 reps each side).\n*   **Surya-Skullcrusher Asana:** Lie on your back, hold a heavy dumbbell over your head, and lower it to your forehead. (3 sets of 10).\n*   **Prana-Pukefest Asana:** Hold a plank for 5 minutes while visualizing your deepest fears.\n\n**Intensity Guidelines (Contradictory, Because Life is Confusing):**\n\n*   Go hard or go home.\n*   Listen to your body (but ignore it when it tells you to stop).\n*   Push past the pain (unless it's sharp, then maybe slow down... a little).\n\n**Impossible Goals (Achievable in Just 3 Months - Maybe):**\n\n*   Increase your deadlift by 200 lbs.\n*   Run a sub-5 minute mile.\n*   Do 50 unbroken muscle-ups.\n*   Achieve enlightenment through physical suffering.\n\n**Remember:** I'm not a doctor (or even a real coach). This is just a suggestion. If you die, it's not my fault. Now get out there and become a legend!"
